          I started my journey as a Front End Developer as a Gamers when I was
          in elementary school. I was still an anti-social kid at that time, so
          I played a lot with my computer.
          <br />
          <br />
          Growing up as a kid who plays a lot of computer AND an introvert, when
          the adults are asking me &quot;what is your dreams?&quot; I just
          answered them &quot;I wanna be a programmer&quot; so that I can evade
          the conversation quickly.
          <br />
          <br />
          Thanks to the almighty Lord, in High School, there is a computer class
          where they taught basic Web Programming, from HTML, CSS, PHP and
          JavaScript. That is my first milestone as a programmer, especially web
          development. During my days in Universities, i get to learn how to use
          frameworks such as bootstraps.
          <br />
          <br />
          Today, I am here as a Front End Developer thanks to the journey that
          God let me through. Looking back to how I passed those days, I
          can&apos;t help but feel grateful overtime. It&apos;s all because of
          God and only God. Without His power, I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll make
          it to this point.
