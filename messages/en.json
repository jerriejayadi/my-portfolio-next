    "desc": "I started my journey as a Front End Developer as a Gamers when I was in elementary school. I was still an anti-social kid at that time, so I played a lot with my computer.<guidelines> Growing up as a kid who plays a lot of computer AND an introvert, when the adults are asking me \"what is your dreams?\" I just answered them I wanna be a programmer\" so that I can evade the conversation quickly.</guidelines><guidelines> Thanks to the almighty Lord, in High School, there is a computer class where they taught basic Web Programming, from HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript. That is my first milestone as a programmer, especially web development. During my days in Universities, i get to learn how to use frameworks such as bootstraps.</guidelines><guidelines> Today, I am here as a Front End Developer thanks to the journey that God let me through. Looking back to how I passed those days, I can't help but feel grateful overtime. It's all because of God and only God. Without His power, I don't think I'll make it to this point.</guidelines>"
